                    to change experiences of those with mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This includes
                    <strong>speaking at conferences and companies</strong>, <strong><a href="/research">conducting research</a></strong>, and
                    <strong><a href="/resources">creating documentation</a></strong> to assist
                    companies in making supportive environments for those impacted by mental health disorders.  He is

                            Nara became involved in OSMI after one of her best friends, a fellow web developer who had battled depression and bipolar disorder for years, took her own life in September 2016. She's interested in using her budding tech speaking career to start more conversations with fellow engineers about how to be better allies in the tech workplace.</p>
