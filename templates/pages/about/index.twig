                    to change experiences of those with mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This includes
                    <strong>speaking at conferences and companies</strong>, <strong><a href="/research">conducting research</a></strong>, and
                    <strong><a href="/resources">creating documentation</a></strong> to assist
                    companies in making supportive environments for those impacted by mental health disorders.  He is
