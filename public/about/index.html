Though she has no noticeable accent, she hails from The Netherlands and lived in Munich, Houston, Pittsburgh, and New York City prior to settling down in Washington, DC. In her spare time, she satisfies her foodie habits by trying out all of the best restaurants in the city, collects board games, and watches too much Netflix.<br><br>

                            Nara became involved in OSMI after one of her best friends, a fellow web developer who had battled depression and bipolar disorder for years, took her own life in September 2016. She's interested in using her budding tech speaking career to start more conversations with fellow engineers about how to be better allies in the tech workplace.</p>

                            <p class="bio hidden volunteer-bio">Allison is a front-end developer at WebDevStudios, a company that specializes in WordPress development. Originally from Southern California, she currently lives in Toronto. Her mental health advocacy is a result of her own lived experience; she wants to create a more open conversation to combat existing stigma and provide additional resources. She loves burritos, hula hoops, and Dolly Parton (not necessarily in that order) and her favourite flightless bird is the kakapo.<br><br>
