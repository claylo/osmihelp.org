Though she has no noticeable accent, she hails from The Netherlands and lived in Munich, Houston, Pittsburgh, and New York City prior to settling down in Washington, DC.

                            Nara became involved in OSMI after one of her best friends, a fellow web developer who had battled depression and bipolar disorder for years, took her own life in September 2016.
